## 1. The Hardware Itself

### 1.0 Three Worlds of Small Computers — ATmega vs ESP32 vs Raspberry Pi
- **[braindump]** Difference between ESP32 and Raspberry Pi — raised in chat but only briefly
- **[gap]** **ATmega328P / Arduino Uno class** — 8-bit AVR, 16 MHz, 2 KB RAM, 32 KB flash, no wireless, no OS, single-threaded `loop()`. Extremely simple, extremely constrained. One program, runs forever, does one thing. Great for learning bare-metal basics, but you hit the ceiling fast. No networking without add-on shields. This is what "classic Arduino" actually is.
- **[gap]** **ESP32 class** — 32-bit (Xtensa or RISC-V), 240 MHz (dual-core on some), 320-520 KB RAM + optional PSRAM, 4-16 MB flash, built-in Wi-Fi + Bluetooth, runs FreeRTOS. Orders of magnitude more capable than ATmega. Can run a web server, TLS, OTA updates, camera streaming, BLE, and multi-threaded tasks simultaneously. Still a microcontroller — no OS filesystem, no display manager, boots in milliseconds, draws milliamps. This is the sweet spot for IoT.
- **[gap]** **Raspberry Pi class** — full ARM Linux computer. Runs Debian, has HDMI, USB, Ethernet, runs Python/Node/Docker/anything. Boots in 30+ seconds, draws 2-5W idle, needs a proper SD card OS image, can corrupt filesystem on power loss. Overkill for blinking an LED, essential for running AI models locally, video processing, or anything that needs a real OS.
- **[gap]** **Key mental model**: ATmega = bare-metal loop, ESP32 = RTOS with networking, RPi = full Linux. Each step up adds 10-100x capability and 10-100x complexity. ESP32 is the "Goldilocks zone" for most IoT projects — enough power to do real things, low enough power/cost to deploy at scale.
- **[gap]** **Why this matters for AI-assisted development**: AI agents can write firmware for all three, but the abstractions are completely different. Arduino code for ATmega is single-file, procedural, no OS. ESP-IDF code is component-based, multi-threaded, event-driven. RPi code is just normal Linux programming. Knowing which world you're in determines everything about how you prompt and what you expect.

- **[braindump]** What that means for reset and boot-log capture — RTS/DTR auto-reset circuit, some boards lack it
- **[braindump]** Driver installation — CP2102, CH340, FTDI chips all need different drivers; Windows can be painful
- **[gap]** USB CDC (Communications Device Class) on chips with native USB — no external bridge needed, but different serial behavior
- **[gap]** Why some boards enumerate as two serial ports (JTAG + serial on native USB chips)

### 1.4 USB Cables — A Surprisingly Deep Topic
- **[braindump]** USB cable quality — many USB-C cables are charge-only with no data lines
- **[braindump]** USB-C vs micro-B — ESP32-CAMs are micro-B, newer boards are USB-C
- **[braindump]** Power Delivery (PD), speeds, chip directions, which work with what

## 2. Power and Electrical Fundamentals

### 2.1 Voltage, Current, and Level Basics

## 4. Common Peripherals and How to Use Them

### 4.1 Displays
- **[braindump]** LCD drivers and touch screens — awareness of LVGL
- **[braindump]** OLED displays — I2C-driven (SSD1306 on the CfB workshop boards)
- **[gap]** TFT LCD displays — SPI-driven (ST7789, ILI9341, GC9A01), much faster with DMA
- **[gap]** LVGL (Light and Versatile Graphics Library) — cross-platform UI framework, runs on ESP32, can simulate on PC
- **[gap]** E-paper / E-ink displays — ultra-low power, partial refresh, slow update rate
- **[gap]** Touch screen controllers — resistive (XPT2046) vs capacitive (FT6236, GT911)

### 4.2 LEDs
- **[braindump]** RGB LEDs, addressable LEDs (WS2815/WS2812B), dimming
- **[gap]** **Active-low LEDs** — many dev boards (and cheap modules) wire the onboard LED between VCC and the GPIO, so the LED turns ON when the pin is LOW and OFF when HIGH. This is the opposite of what most people expect. If your "turn LED on" code doesn't work, try inverting the logic. Extremely common gotcha on ESP32 dev boards, NodeMCU, and many Chinese modules.
- **[gap]** **Plain LEDs** — single-color, need a current-limiting resistor (typically 220Ω–1kΩ for 3.3V), one GPIO per LED, controlled via digital HIGH/LOW or PWM for dimming (LEDC peripheral)
- **[gap]** **Addressable LED strip protocols — not all the same**:
  - **WS2812B** — single data wire, 800 kHz, 24-bit color (GRB order), 5V logic but often tolerates 3.3V data. Most common. Timing-critical — one corrupted bit shifts all downstream pixels.
  - **WS2815** — single data wire, 12V power (higher voltage = less voltage drop over long runs), has backup data line so one dead pixel doesn't kill the rest of the strip.
  - **SK6812** — WS2812B-compatible protocol but available in RGBW (four channels — separate white LED for better whites).
  - **APA102 / SK9822** — two-wire protocol (data + clock). Clock line means timing is not critical, much easier to drive reliably, supports higher refresh rates. More expensive. SPI-compatible.
  - **WS2811** — older, slower (400 kHz), external driver IC (one IC can drive 3 LEDs), 12V.
- **[gap]** RMT peripheral — ESP32's built-in peripheral perfect for driving addressable LEDs (no bitbanging needed)
- **[gap]** LED strips vs matrices — different wiring, power distribution considerations
- **[gap]** FastLED vs Adafruit NeoPixel vs ESP-IDF RMT driver — library choices
- **[gap]** Power injection — long LED strips need power fed at multiple points
- **[gap]** **Driving high-current LEDs and strips with FETs** — a single GPIO can't power a strip (60 LEDs × 60mA = 3.6A at full white). Data line is low-current (signal only), but the strip's VCC needs a beefy external supply. For non-addressable LED strips (single-color or analog RGB), you switch each channel with a logic-level N-channel MOSFET (e.g., IRLZ44N) — one FET per color channel, PWM from the ESP32 GPIO on the gate, strip power through drain-source. Same principle applies to high-power single LEDs (1W+ power LEDs need a constant-current driver or FET + resistor).

- **[braindump]** The `export.sh` (Unix) / `export.bat` (Windows) script that sets up paths and environment
- **[gap]** CMake build system — `CMakeLists.txt`, `idf_component.yml`, how ESP-IDF projects are structured
- **[gap]** `idf.py` commands — `build`, `flash`, `monitor`, `menuconfig`, `set-target`, `fullclean`
- **[gap]** Component architecture — ESP-IDF's modular system, public/private components, component registry
- **[gap]** sdkconfig and menuconfig — project configuration via Kconfig, `sdkconfig.defaults` for version-controlled defaults

### 11.2 Arduino Framework
- **[braindump]** Arduino vs ESP-IDF — Arduino losing appeal but still useful for beginners; lots of training data for AI
- **[braindump]** Arduino CLI — `arduino-cli`, agents love CLIs, can install and flash from terminal
- **[braindump]** arduino-esp32 — Arduino core for ESP32, wraps ESP-IDF, one-click install
- **[braindump]** Arduino will dwindle over time — AI can now write directly in native frameworks
- **[gap]** Arduino limitations — single-threaded loop model, hides RTOS, limited access to ESP-IDF features
- **[gap]** Mixing Arduino and ESP-IDF — possible but messy, component system conflicts

### 11.3 PlatformIO
- **[braindump]** PlatformIO as middle ground — VS Code extension, manages toolchain, board definitions
- **[braindump]** `platformio.ini` — project config file, agents recognize it instantly
- **[braindump]** Hobby-grade vs professional — PlatformIO fine for hobby, ESP-IDF for anything serious
- **[gap]** Board definitions — how PlatformIO maps board names to chip configs, creating custom board definitions

### 11.4 The Shell/Path Problem for AI Agents
- **[braindump]** Paths and environment variables get non-trivial — your terminal vs what the AI spawns are different things
- **[braindump]** Persistent terminal sessions vs re-spawning — most IDEs spawn new shells per command, so path settings don't stick
- **[braindump]** Terminal MCP for persistent sessions — dedicated tool for firmware dev (https://github.com/AuraFriday/terminal_mcp)
- **[braindump]** VS Code extension manages toolchain — but AI agent needs CLI access to the same tools
- **[braindump]** `.vscode/settings.json` — can configure tasks and paths
- **[braindump]** `.claude/settings.json` and `.claude/settings.local.json` — agent permission allow-lists for tools
- **[gap]** Windows `export.bat` vs Unix `export.sh` — different environments, different setup
- **[gap]** Python virtual environments — ESP-IDF creates its own venv; conflicts with system Python are common

### 11.5 IDE Choices for AI-Assisted Development
- **[braindump]** Cursor / VS Code — most common among CfB attendees
- **[braindump]** Claude Code — terminal-based, different shell behavior
- **[braindump]** OpenCode — with LSP and hooks support
- **[gap]** Windsurf, Codex, Copilot — other AI coding tools and their ESP32 compatibility
- **[gap]** ESP-IDF VS Code extension — manages install, version selection, multi-target; but AI may not use it directly

## 13. AI-Assisted and Agentic Firmware Development

### 13.1 Agentic Coding Workflow for Firmware
- **[braindump]** What agentic firmware development looks like — agent builds, flashes, reads serial output, iterates
- **[braindump]** Iteration loop on hardware is much slower than software — build/flash/test cycle takes minutes not seconds
- **[braindump]** "AI automated" vs "AI assisted" — beginners want full automation, experienced devs want assistance
- **[braindump]** Prompting things into existence "just works" — even complex projects done before lunchtime
- **[braindump]** Self-referential debugging — point ESP32-CAM at an LCD, tell AI to iterate until it can read the output

### 13.2 Sub-Agents and Specialized Agents
- **[braindump]** ESP-IDF expert developer agent — specialized knowledge
- **[braindump]** LVGL agent — runs simulation on PC as LVGL is cross-platform
- **[braindump]** Compliance agents — MISRA, NASA JPL coding standards
- **[gap]** Creating agent instruction files — `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.cursorrules` with ESP32-specific context
- **[gap]** Providing datasheets and pin maps to the agent — giving it the hardware context it needs for one-shot builds

### 13.3 MCP Servers and Tool Integration
- **[braindump]** MCP servers for firmware dev — closing the loop on development
- **[braindump]** Serial MCP — persistent serial connection, agent can flash and test
- **[braindump]** Agent hooks — deterministic workflow triggers (lint, format, test on file save)
- **[braindump]** Guarding agents with tools — error feedback for incorrect tool usage
- **[braindump]** Script contribution pattern — agents contribute to compile/run/test/release scripts rather than ad-hoc bash

### 13.4 GitHub Integration for Firmware Projects
- **[braindump]** Integrate with GitHub issues — agent fetches issues and implements them
- **[braindump]** Orchestrator workflows — issues → triage → plan → build → review → QA → publish MR
- **[braindump]** Multi-agent development — multiple agents assigned work from issues
- **[braindump]** Knowledge graphs — for memory and context across sessions

### 13.5 Agent Tutoring and Learning
- **[braindump]** Agent as tutor — ask naive questions, agent teaches from first principles
- **[braindump]** Notes.md approach — agent maintains a context file that persists across sessions
- **[braindump]** Starter prompt for beginners — a markdown snippet that frames the agent as teacher and builder
- **[braindump]** Voice programming — Kokoro + Whisper (TTS/STT) for hands-free coding

## 14. Practical Gotchas and Traps

### 14.1 Hardware Traps
- **[braindump]** USB cables — charge-only cables are the #1 gotcha
- **[braindump]** Buying traps — cheapest option in a listing often isn't what the listing shows (missing case, missing carrier board)
- **[braindump]** Reading datasheets — knowing what to pay attention to
- **[gap]** ADC2 and Wi-Fi conflict — cannot use ADC2 channels while Wi-Fi is active
- **[gap]** GPIO0 and GPIO2 — strapping pins that affect boot mode; connecting peripherals to them can prevent booting
- **[gap]** Pin behavior at boot — some GPIOs output PWM during boot; relays/motors can twitch
- **[gap]** Insufficient decoupling — random resets, Wi-Fi drops, sensor glitches
- **[gap]** Ground loops — when connecting multiple power sources, share a common ground

### 14.2 Software Traps
- **[gap]** Stack overflow — silent corruption or crash; increase task stack size; enable stack overflow checking in menuconfig
- **[gap]** Blocking the main task — if you block for too long, the watchdog resets the chip
- **[gap]** `delay(0)` vs `yield()` vs `vTaskDelay(1)` — different ways to yield, different behaviors
- **[gap]** String handling in C — buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, use `snprintf` not `sprintf`
- **[gap]** Flash write limits — NVS and SPIFFS write to flash; writing every second will wear it out; batch writes
- **[gap]** Wi-Fi reconnection — must handle disconnects gracefully; Wi-Fi is not reliable, implement auto-reconnect
- **[gap]** OTA bricking — if your new firmware crashes before OTA handler starts, you've lost wireless update capability

### 14.3 Development Environment Traps
- **[braindump]** IDF path/environment setup — the #1 pain point for new developers
- **[braindump]** Prerequisites on Mac — undocumented deps, PATH issues on Apple Silicon
- **[braindump]** Windows GUI installer doesn't tell you what the setup command was
- **[gap]** Python version conflicts — ESP-IDF requires specific Python version, conflicts with system Python
- **[gap]** Long paths on Windows — ESP-IDF nested paths can exceed Windows MAX_PATH (260 chars)
- **[gap]** Antivirus interference — Windows Defender can slow builds enormously; exclude the ESP-IDF directory
